# Camera Setup
This project uses a Mujoco simulation environment with a camera mounted on the Franka robotic hand for conducting various experiments.
## Camera Configuration
- **Location**: Mounted on Franka hand end-effector
- **Simulation**: Mujoco-based physics engine
- **Purpose**: Visual feedback for experiment validation and data collection
## Usage
The camera is integrated into the Mujoco simulation to capture hand-centric viewpoints during robotic tasks and admittance control experiments.
